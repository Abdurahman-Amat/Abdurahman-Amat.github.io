# I AM
Hi, my official name is **Aimaiti Rehemanjiang** and I am a physicist by training with a PhD degree from the Philipps University Marburg, Germany. After my PhD and Postdoc research work, I trained myself in the direction of Data Science, Machine Learning in order to get to know this interesting and rather challenging field. Since the beginning of the pandemic (Covid-19), I have been working as a IT-Systemadministrator (sysadmin) at the Archivschule Marburg - College of Archival Science-.
