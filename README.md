# I AM
My official name is Aimaiti Rehemanjiang and I am a physicist by training with a PhD degree from The Philipps University Marburg, Germany. After my PhD and Postdoc research work, I trained myself in the direction of Data Science, Machine Learning in order to get a job in this new and rather challenging field. Since the beginning of the pandemic (Covid-19), I have been working as a system administrator at the Archive School of Marburg -College of archival science-. I am looking for a new role and ready to face new challenges.
